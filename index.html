            <p><strong>Address:</strong>Tampere, Finland</p>
            <p>. my studies was
                Interdisciplinarity with more focus on the
                material science aspect . 
                As a biophysics graduate with a passion for research, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a position as a research assistant in photonics with a focus on biological applications. With a strong foundation in optics, instrumentation, and biology, I am equipped to design and conduct experiments, collect and analyze data, and contribute to the development of novel photonics-based technologies for biological applications. My previous work experience in the field of biomedical engineering have enabled me to develop excellent problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a rigorous approach to experimentation. I am highly motivated,
                results-oriented, and always looking for new
                challenges to take on.
